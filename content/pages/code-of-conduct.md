# Code of Conduct

The heart and soul of a user group event is the community that it serves. PHPem is run by passionate volunteers, organising events that benefit both developers and their companies.

As organisers, we consider each and every one of our attendees, sponsors and speakers as our guest, and we expect everyone to feel welcome, respected and safe. Please make it your aim to ensure all of our guests feel welcome and comfortable.

Any unsuitable behaviour may result in Event access being revoked.

PHPem is a good crowd, and we will endeavour to make sure it stays that way.

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct is here to outline the expected behaviour of attendees and also the consequences of any unacceptable behaviour.


We hope that everyone attending can have a good experience.

## Expected Behaviour

Please show respect to everyone in and around the event Venue. This is not exclusively for people attending the Event but also members of the public and venue Staff who may be in and around the venue. Do not participate in any demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour. Be respectful of the environment you are in. If you do notice anything dangerous or anybody in distress, do contact the event organisers or the venue staff as soon as possible.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include: intimidating, bullying, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any delegates of our PHPem Event. As our events are being held in a venue, there may be members of the public around at all times. It is important to ensure that they are respected too. Remember to think before you speak. Sexist, racist and other provocative remarks or jokes may be offensive to the people around you. Use of these comments will not be tolerated at any time.


If you feel you are the victim, or see anyone else as the victim of this behaviour, please ensure you alert a member of the PHPem team or the venue staff as soon as possible.

## Consequences Of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated by anyone attending the Event from delegates, speakers, sponsors or organisers. Anybody that is asked to stop their unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply with this immediately. If this behaviour then continues, further action will be taken. A further warning may be given or Event access may be revoked with no refund.

## Scope

It is the responsibility of everyone attending the event to read this Code of Conduct and comply with it, thus making the Event another positive experience for everyone involved.

## Contact Information

PHPem can also provide you with information relating to the Code of Conduct, the Event and also other services via email, direct mail, fax or telephone. Please email [info@phpem.uk](mailto:info@phpem.uk) or you can follow us on Twitter: [@PHPem](https://twitter.com/phpem).

 
If you need to contact someone regarding conduct whilst the events are underway, please find a member of the PHPem team. They can be identified by T-shirts or Lanyards, so it should be easy to identify them from the beginning of the event. If you cannot locate one of the team, you can also inform the venue staff who will ensure the correct action is enforced.
